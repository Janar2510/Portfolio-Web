# 15-Minute Manual UI Test

**Run this yourself — no AI. Brutally effective.**

---

## Minute 0–3: First Impression

**Open Dashboard**

1. Do nothing for 5 seconds
2. Ask:
   - Where should my eyes go?
   - Is anything screaming?

**If you feel "busy" → fail.**

---

## Minute 3–6: Navigation Sanity

**Click every sidebar item**

Watch content shift. Check:
- Jumps?
- Layout shifts?
- Inconsistent padding?

**Any jump = structural bug.**

---

## Minute 6–9: Form Reality Check

**Open editor**

1. Click into inputs
2. Type text
3. Tab through fields

Ask:
- Can I work here for 2 hours?
- Are labels readable?
- Does focus feel safe?

**If not → redesign inputs, not colors.**

---

## Minute 9–12: Contrast & Fatigue

**Lower screen brightness**

1. Lean back
2. Squint slightly

**If content disappears → contrast is wrong.**

---

## Minute 12–15: Kill the Ego

**Hide all:**
- Gradients
- Glow
- Animations

**Does the UI still work?**

**If not → effects were masking bad layout.**

---

## Pass/Fail Criteria

### PASS if:
✅ Calm  
✅ Readable  
✅ Consistent  
✅ Could work here for hours  

### FAIL if:
❌ Busy  
❌ Jumpy  
❌ Inconsistent  
❌ Fatiguing

## The Ultimate Test

**Would you use this for 8 hours a day?**

If no → it's not done.
