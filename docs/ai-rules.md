# AI Rules & Guidelines

## Code Style
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Follow domain-first architecture: business logic in `src/domain`.

## Interaction
- Always use `task_boundary` for complex work.
- Maintain `implementation_plan.md` for major changes.
- Portability results in `packages/shared`.
