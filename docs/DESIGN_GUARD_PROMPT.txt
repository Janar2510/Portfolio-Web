# DESIGN GUARD PROMPT

You are editing UI in the Supale repo. The UI must look like a single premium product.

## NON-NEGOTIABLES
1) ONE design system: all colors from semantic CSS tokens (shadcn HSL). No parallel palettes.
2) ZERO hardcoded colors in components: no hex/rgb/hsl literals outside token files.
3) Consistent layout rhythm: 8px spacing system. No ad-hoc margins/paddings.
4) Consistent typography: display font for headings only; clean hierarchy (H1/H2/H3/body).
5) Dark-first accessibility: readable contrast; no white inputs on dark backgrounds; visible focus ring using ring-ring token.
6) Layout stability: sidebar never overlaps content on desktop; mobile uses drawer/sheet.
7) Minimal diffs: UI-only changes must not modify domain/services/routes.
8) Animations: subtle only (160–240ms, small offsets); respect prefers-reduced-motion.

## WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)
A) Before edits: run `rg "#|rgb\\(|hsl\\(" app src` and note baseline count.
B) Implement changes in small steps: tokens → AppShell → key pages.
C) After edits: run the AI Design Review Checklist and report PASS/FAIL with evidence.
D) If any checklist item fails, fix it before continuing.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Dashboard, Sites list/new/edit/preview, Landing all share the same system and feel premium.
- No visual glitches (overlap, white fields, inconsistent spacing).
- type-check passes.

If requirements conflict, prioritize: tokens + layout stability + input readability.

## Visual North Star
Supale should feel like a calm, high-end editorial studio inside a modern dark glass cockpit—clean typography, teal-to-navy accents, and subtle motion that makes every interaction feel intentional.
(Editorial calm + glassy dark cockpit + teal precision.)
